# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository provides an in-depth overview of Requirement Analysis, a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It outlines its importance, processes, types, and tools used to define and validate system requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. It ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

This process involves communicating with stakeholders, understanding business needs, translating them into technical requirements, and ensuring they are feasible and testable. It sets the foundation for successful system design, development, and deployment.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding:** Reduces ambiguity by clearly capturing stakeholders' expectations.
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope, preventing scope creep and feature bloat.
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Ensures the design and development teams build exactly what is needed.
- **Cost and Time Estimation:** Enables realistic budgeting and scheduling.
- **Quality Assurance:** Leads to a product that meets user needs, ensuring satisfaction.
